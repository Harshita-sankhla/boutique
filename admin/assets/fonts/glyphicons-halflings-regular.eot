Project Roadmap:
Initial Planning and Requirements Gathering (Week 1)

Define the Scope: Determine the key functionalities of the chatbot (e.g., answering FAQs about admission, campus events, exam schedules).
Identify Target Users: Understand the students’ and staff’s needs, what types of queries they would ask, and what kind of responses the chatbot should provide.
Choose Platforms: Decide on the platforms the chatbot will be available on (e.g., website, mobile app, etc.).
Gather Data: Collect common student queries, event information, exam schedules, and other content that the chatbot will need to know.
Set Up AWS Services (Week 2)

Create AWS Account: If you don’t already have one, create an AWS account.
Set Up IAM Roles: Create roles and permissions to securely access AWS Lex, Polly, and other necessary AWS services.
Enable Services: Set up AWS Lex for chatbot creation and AWS Polly for text-to-speech functionality.
Chatbot Design & Intent Mapping (Week 3)

Design Chatbot Flow: Define how the chatbot will interact with users. Break down the user intents (types of queries) the bot should handle. For example:
Admission inquiries (e.g., application deadlines, requirements)
Event schedules (e.g., campus events, seminars)
Exam schedules (e.g., upcoming exams, results)
Academic advising (e.g., course information, credits)
Define Slots & Entities: In AWS Lex, define the "slots" (variables) that will help fill in specific user information, such as dates or courses.
Develop AWS Lex Bot (Week 4-5)

Create a New Bot: Use the AWS Lex console to create a new chatbot.
Choose a Bot name (e.g., "CollegeAssistant").
Select Language (e.g., English).
Configure IAM Role for the bot’s permissions.
Create Intents: Intents represent what the user wants. For example, "Get Exam Schedule" or "Inquire about Admission". Set up these intents in Lex, and define sample phrases for each intent (e.g., "When is the admission deadline?" or "Tell me about upcoming events").
Define Slots: For intents that require specific information (like date, course name, or event name), define slots to capture these data points.
Set Up Fulfillment: When an intent is triggered, the chatbot needs to respond. Define how Lex should fulfill each intent, whether it will be static responses or pulling data from an external source (like a database or API).
Build the Bot: After setting up the intents, slots, and responses, build the bot in the AWS Lex console.
Test the Bot: Use the Lex console's built-in testing interface to interact with your bot and verify it handles the intents correctly.
Integrate AWS Polly for Text-to-Speech (Week 6)

Enable AWS Polly: In AWS Lex, enable Polly to convert text-based responses into speech.
Customize Voices: Choose the voice that best fits your chatbot (e.g., a neutral, friendly voice). Polly supports multiple languages and voice types.
Add Text-to-Speech Responses: Modify the responses of the chatbot so that they’re read aloud via Polly when needed (e.g., exam schedules, event announcements).
Test: Ensure that text-to-speech functionality works smoothly for all responses.
Create User Interface (Week 7)

Frontend Development: Create a simple interface where users (students, staff) can interact with the chatbot. This could be on a webpage, a mobile app, or within an existing college portal.
If you’re using a website, embed the chatbot using the AWS Lex SDK for JavaScript.
If you're using a mobile app, you can integrate AWS Lex using AWS Amplify or directly through the AWS Mobile SDK.
Design Chat UI: Ensure the chat interface is user-friendly. The interface should include a text box for input, a message window for responses, and a voice button to trigger Polly for speech.
Connect Frontend to AWS Lex: Use AWS SDK or AWS Amplify to connect the frontend (website or mobile app) to your AWS Lex bot.
Integration with College Data (Week 8)

Connect Data Sources: If your chatbot needs real-time data (like exam schedules, event information), integrate it with the college’s data sources.
For event schedules, you might link the bot to a calendar API or a Google Calendar.
For exam schedules or admission information, you can store the data in an AWS DynamoDB database or an S3 bucket.
Dynamic Responses: Modify the bot to query these data sources based on the user's request and dynamically generate responses.
Testing & Debugging (Week 9)

Test Interactions: Perform thorough testing of your chatbot to ensure that it answers questions accurately and behaves as expected.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Get feedback from students, faculty, and staff to ensure the chatbot is helpful and intuitive.
Improve NLP: Refine the bot’s ability to understand different ways users might ask the same question.
Deployment & Launch (Week 10)

Deploy to College Website: Once testing is complete and feedback has been implemented, deploy the chatbot on the college website or mobile app.
Launch Chatbot: Make the chatbot accessible to all students and staff, and provide a clear call-to-action for users to try it out (e.g., "Ask me about events or your exams!").
Monitor Usage: After launch, monitor how users are interacting with the bot. Use AWS CloudWatch for logs and metrics to see how well the bot is performing.
Post-Launch Improvements (Ongoing)

User Feedback: Continuously gather feedback from users to improve the chatbot’s functionality. This could be through surveys or direct feedback within the chatbot interface.
Iterate and Improve: Add new features, improve intent handling, or extend the bot to answer more complex questions over time.
AI Enhancements: Enhance the bot’s capabilities with machine learning or more advanced NLP features to handle more nuanced conversations.
Technology Stack
AWS Lex: For building and training the chatbot’s conversational flow.
AWS Polly: For converting text responses into speech.
AWS Lambda: Optional, for additional backend logic (e.g., querying databases, performing custom actions).
AWS Amplify: For integrating AWS Lex into your web or mobile app.
Amazon DynamoDB / S3: For storing and retrieving dynamic data (like event schedules, exam dates).
AWS CloudWatch: For monitoring and logging chatbot activity.
Key Features to Implement:
Multi-Intent Handling: The bot should be able to handle multiple intents simultaneously, e.g., answering questions about exams and events at the same time.
Slot Filling: Ensure the chatbot asks for missing information (e.g., asking for the specific date or course name).
Fallback Intent: If the bot doesn’t understand the query, it should offer a fallback response and suggest rephrasing the question.
Voice Interaction: Use AWS Polly to make the interaction more engaging by providing spoken responses.
Error Handling: Ensure the bot gracefully handles errors and provides helpful responses if something goes wrong.
